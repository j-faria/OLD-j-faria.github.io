Since the discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star (missing reference) we have found many other worlds outside our Solar System. Most of them very different from what we expected. Which is good because science would be dull if everything was as expected.

Today, astronomers (me included) are looking for smaller planets, slightly larger than the Earth. We use a handful of different methods to detect these exoplanets. Transits and radial velocities are by far the two most successful, but astrometry, direct imaging and gravitational microlensing also play an important role.


I work with radial-velocitiy data. Specifically, data from one of the best spectrographs we have, HARPS. I use these data to search for planets around stars with low metallicity, because we are not sure if planets are common around this type of stars. 

The issue is that detecting low mass planets (the ones we are interested in) is quite difficult and requires a large number of measurements! 

It also requires complex data analysis techniques in order to detect the radial-velocity signals, at the level of 1 m/s or less, that are induced by the planets. Furthermore, contaminations from stellar activity and instrument systematics can produce spurious signals that mimic planetary signals. Thus, they need to be taken into account when trying to detect very low mass planets. 

This is where my love of statistics and probability comes into play.

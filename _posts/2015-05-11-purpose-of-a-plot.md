Inspired by the works of Edward Tufte and Jean-luc Doumont (or, I should say, my interpretration of their work), I have recently started to create new visualisations of my data. These go beyond simply changing the default values of the tool I use to make plots (matplotlib). A plot can also convey information in less standard ways.


<ul class="clearing-thumbs small-block-grid-2" data-clearing>
  <li><a href="{{ site.url }}/images/histogram1.png"><img data-caption="caption 1" src="{{ site.url }}/images/histogram1.png"></a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.url }}/images/histogram2.png"><img data-caption="caption 2" src="{{ site.url }}/images/histogram2.png"></a></li>
</ul>

For example, the use of linearly spaced axis tick labels is completely arbitrary and only serves to decrease Tufte's Data-Ink ratio. The plots above are an example on how to make the axis labels convey extra information. They both show the same data. On the right, I only label the minimum, mean and maximum values on the x axis. This way, the axis gives a substantial ammount of information, and all it takes is a quick glance.

Despite the aesthetical differences between the two plots, which I will discuss another time, there is also a functional difference, as the right plot fulfils its purpose more fully.

When sampling is from a normal distribution, our results indicate that, for equal sample sizes, the t test is insensitive to variance heterogeneity and hence no preliminary test is necessary. For unequal sample sizes, the F test has small probability of detecting many alternatives for which the t test performs poorly, and so the F test is not an effective preliminary test. When sampling is from other distributions, our results confirm the sensitivity of the F test to the normality assumption.},

  abstract = {Doppler spectroscopy has uncovered or confirmed all the known planets orbiting nearby stars. Two main techniques are used to obtain precision Doppler measurements at optical wavelengths. The first approach is the gas cell method, which consists of least-squares matching of the spectrum of iodine imprinted on the spectrum of the star. The second method relies on the construction of a stabilized spectrograph externally calibrated in wavelength. The most precise stabilized spectrometer in operation is the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS), operated by the European Southern Observatory in La Silla Observatory, Chile. The Doppler measurements obtained with HARPS are typically obtained using the cross-correlation function (CCF) technique. This technique consists of multiplying the stellar spectrum by a weighted binary mask and finding the minimum of the product as a function of the Doppler shift. It is known that CCF is suboptimal in exploiting the Doppler information in the stellar spectrum. Here we describe an algorithm to obtain precision radial velocity measurements using least-squares matching of each observed spectrum to a high signal-to-noise ratio template derived from the same observations. This algorithm is implemented in our software HARPS-TERRA (Template-Enhanced Radial velocity Re-analysis Application). New radial velocity measurements on a representative sample of stars observed by HARPS are used to illustrate the benefits of the proposed method. We show that, compared with CCF, template matching provides a significant improvement in accuracy, especially when applied to M dwarfs.},

  shorttitle = {Disentangling 2},
  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07769},
  abstract = {In radial velocity observations, a pair of extrasolar planets near a 2:1 orbital resonance can be misinterpreted as a single eccentric planet, if data are sparse and measurement precision insufficient to distinguish between these models. We determine the fraction of alleged single-planet RV detected systems for which a 2:1 resonant pair of planets is also a viable model and address the question of how the models can be disentangled. By simulation we quantified the mismatch arising from applying the wrong model. Model alternatives are illustrated using the supposed single-planet system HD 27894 for which we also study the dynamical stability of near-2:1 resonant solutions. From the data scatter around the fitted single-planet Keplerians, we find that for \$74{\textbackslash}\% \$ of the \$254\$ putative single-planet systems, a 2:1 resonant pair cannot be excluded as a viable model, since the error due to the wrong model is smaller than the scatter. For \$187\$ stars \${\textbackslash}chi \^{}2\$-probabilities can be used to reject the Keplerian models with a confidence of \$95{\textbackslash}\% \$ for \$54{\textbackslash}\% \$ of the stars and with \$99.9{\textbackslash}\% \$ for \$39{\textbackslash}\% \$ of the stars. For HD 27894 a considerable fit improvement is obtained when adding a low-mass planet near half the orbital period of the known Jovian planet. Dynamical analysis demonstrates that this system is stable when both planets are initially placed on circular orbits. For fully Keplerian orbits a stable system is only obtained if the eccentricity of the inner planet is constrained to \$\ensuremath{<}0.3\$. A large part of the allegedly RV detected single-planet systems should be scrutinized in order to determine the fraction of systems containing near-2:1 resonant pairs of planets. Knowing the abundance of such systems will allow us to revise the eccentricity distribution for extrasolar planets and provide direct constraints for planetary system formation.},

starspots on Sun-like stars. The largest sunspots can produce a radial velocity variation of several m s-1 and an astrometric signal of order tens of micro-arcseconds in a nearby solar-type star. The latter is well above the measurement precision of 4 micro-arcsecs provided by the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM). A combination of precise photometric, radial velocity, and astrometric measurements may enable us to derive spot distributions on slowly rotating late-type stars with solar-like levels of activity.},

  abstract = {Tidal Downsizing (TD) is a recently developed planet formation theory that supplements the classical Gravitational disc Instability (GI) model with planet migration inward and tidal disruptions of GI fragments in the inner regions of the disc. Numerical methods for a detailed population synthesis of TD planets are presented here. As an example application, the conditions under which GI fragments collapse faster than they migrate into the inner \$a{\textbackslash}sim\$ few AU disc are considered. It is found that most gas fragments are tidally or thermally disrupted unless (a) their opacity is \${\textbackslash}sim 3\$ orders of magnitude less than the interstellar dust opacity at metallicities typical of the observed giant planets, or (b) the opacity is high but the fragments accrete large dust grains (pebbles) from the disc. Case (a) models produce very low mass solid cores (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm core\} \ensuremath{<} 0.1\$ Earth masses) and follow a negative correlation of giant planet frequency with host star metallicity. In contrast, case (b) models produce massive solid cores, correlate positively with host metallicity and explain naturally while giant gas planets are over-abundant in metals.},

  abstract = {Recently, a new planet candidate was discovered on direct images around the young (10-17 Myr) A-type star HD 95086. The strong infrared excess of the system indicates that, similar to HR8799, \ensuremath{\beta} Pic, and
Fomalhaut, the star harbors a circumstellar disk. Aiming to study the structure and gas content of the HD 95086 disk, and to investigate its possible interaction with the newly discovered planet, here we present new optical, infrared, and millimeter observations. We detected no CO emission, excluding the possibility of an evolved gaseous primordial disk. Simple blackbody modeling of the spectral energy distribution suggests the presence of two spatially separate dust belts at radial distances of 6 and 64 AU. Our resolved images obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory reveal a characteristic disk size of {\textasciitilde}6.''0 {\texttimes}
5.''4 (540 {\texttimes} 490 AU) and disk inclination of {\textasciitilde}25{\textdegree}. Assuming
the same inclination for the planet candidate's orbit, its reprojected radial distance from the star is 62 AU, very close to the blackbody radius of the outer cold dust ring. The structure of the planetary system at HD 95086 resembles the one around HR8799. Both systems harbor a warm inner dust belt and a broad colder outer disk and giant planet(s) between the two dusty regions. Modeling implies that the candidate planet can dynamically excite the motion of planetesimals even out to 270 AU via their secular perturbation if its orbital eccentricity is larger than about 0.4. Our analysis adds a new example to the three known systems where directly imaged planet(s) and debris disks coexist.},

  shorttitle = {Planet Traps and Planetary Cores},
  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1841},
  abstract = {Massive exoplanets are observed preferentially around high metallicity ({[}Fe/H{]}) stars while low-mass exoplanets do not show such an effect. This so-called planet-metallicity correlation generally favors the idea that most observed gas giants at \$r\ensuremath{<}10\$ AU are formed via a core accretion process. We investigate the origin of this phenomenon using a semi-analystical model, wherein the standard core accretion takes place at planet traps in protostellar disks where rapid type I migrators are halted. We focus on the three major exoplanetary populations - hot-Jupiters, exo-Jupiters located at \$r {\textbackslash}simeq 1\$ AU, and the low-mass planets. We show using a statistical approach that the planet-metallicity correlations are well reproduced in these models. We find that there are specific transition metallicities with values {[}Fe/H{]}\$=-0.2\$ to \$-0.4\$, below which the low-mass population dominates, and above which the Jovian populations take over. The exo-Jupiters significantly exceed the hot-Jupiter population at all observed metallicities. The low-mass planets formed via the core accretion are insensitive to metallicity, which may account for a large fraction of the observed super-Earths and hot-Neptunes. Finally, a controlling factor in building massive planets is the critical mass of planetary cores (\$M\_\{c,crit\}\$) that regulates the onset of runaway gas accretion. Assuming the current data is roughly complete at {[}Fe/H{]}\$\ensuremath{>}-0.6\$, our models predict that the most likely value of the "mean" critical core mass of Jovian planets is \${\textbackslash}braket\{\vphantom{\}}M\_\{c,crit\}\vphantom{\{}\} {\textbackslash}simeq 5 M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ rather than \$10 M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$. This implies that grain opacities in accreting envelopes should play an important role in lowering \$M\_\{c,crit\}\$.},

  abstract = {We present an update to seven stars with long-period planets or planetary candidates using new and archival radial velocities from Keck-HIRES and literature velocities from other telescopes. Our updated analysis better constrains orbital parameters for these planets, four of which are known multi-planet systems. HD 24040 b and HD 183263 c are super-Jupiters with circular orbits and periods longer than 8 yr. We present a previously unseen linear trend in the residuals of HD 66428 indicative on an additional planetary companion. We confirm that GJ 849 is a multi-planet system and find a good orbital solution for the c component: it is a \$1 M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$ planet in a 15 yr orbit (the longest known for a planet orbiting an M dwarf). We update the HD 74156 double-planet system. We also announce the detection of HD 145934 b, a \$2 M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$ planet in a 7.5 yr orbit around a giant star. Two of our stars, HD 187123 and HD 217107, at present host the only known examples of systems comprising a hot Jupiter and a planet with a well constrained period \$\ensuremath{>} 5\$ yr, and with no evidence of giant planets in between. Our enlargement and improvement of long-period planet parameters will aid future analysis of origins, diversity, and evolution of planetary systems.},

  abstract = {We investigate the possibility of constraining the sin i degeneracy of alpha Cen B b -- with orbital period P=3.24 d; a = 0.042 AU; msini = 1.1 M\_earth -- to estimate the true mass of the newly reported terrestrial exoplanet in the nearest stellar system to our Sun. We present detailed numerical simulations of the dynamical stability of the exoplanet in the alpha Cen AB binary system for a range of initial inclinations, eccentricities, and semi-major axes. The system represents a benchmark case for the interplay of the Kozai mechanism, general relativistic and tidal forces. From our simulations, there is only a small boundary in initial inclinations and initial semi-major axes that result in the migration via the Kozai mechanism of alpha Cen B b to its present location. Inside this boundary, the planet orbit is stable for up to 1 Gyr against the Kozai mechanism, and outside this boundary the planet collides with alpha Cen B or is ejected. In our three simulations where the planet migrates in towards the star via the Kozai mechanism, the final inclination is 46-53 degrees relative to the AB orbital plane, lower than the initial inclination of 75 degrees in each case. We discuss inclination constraints from the formation of alpha Cen B b in situ at its present location, migration in a proto-planetary disk, or migration in resonance with additional planets. We conclude that alpha Cen B b probably has a mass of less than 2.7 M\_earth, implying a likely terrestrial composition warranting future confirmation.},

  volume = {49},
  issn = {0098-3004},
  doi = {10.1016/j.cageo.2012.06.018},
  abstract = {Many spectral analysis techniques have been designed assuming sequences taken with a constant sampling interval. However, there are empirical time series in the geosciences (sediment cores, fossil abundance data, isotope analysis, {\ldots}) that do not follow regular sampling because of missing data, gapped data, random sampling or incomplete sequences, among other reasons. In general, interpolating an uneven series in order to obtain a succession with a constant sampling interval alters the spectral content of the series. In such cases it is preferable to follow an approach that works with the uneven data directly, avoiding the need for an explicit interpolation step. The Lomb{\textendash}Scargle periodogram is a popular choice in such circumstances, as there are programs available in the public domain for its computation. One new computer program for spectral analysis improves the standard Lomb{\textendash}Scargle periodogram approach in two ways: (1) It explicitly adjusts the statistical significance to any bias introduced by variance reduction smoothing, and (2) it uses a permutation test to evaluate confidence levels, which is better suited than parametric methods when neighbouring frequencies are highly correlated.

Another novel program for cross-spectral analysis offers the advantage of estimating the Lomb{\textendash}Scargle cross-periodogram of two uneven time series defined on the same interval, and it evaluates the confidence levels of the estimated cross-spectra by a non-parametric computer intensive permutation test. Thus, the cross-spectrum, the squared coherence spectrum, the phase spectrum, and the Monte Carlo statistical significance of the cross-spectrum and the squared-coherence spectrum can be obtained.

Both of the programs are written in ANSI Fortran 77, in view of its simplicity and compatibility. The program code is of public domain, provided on the website of the journal (http://www.iamg.org/index.php/publisher/articleview/frmArticleID/112/).

Different examples (with simulated and real data) are described in this paper to corroborate the methodology and the implementation of these two new programs.},

  abstract = {We introduce a general Monte Carlo method based on Nested Sampling (NS), for sampling complex probability distributions and estimating the normalising constant. The method uses one or more particles, which explore a mixture of nested probability distributions, each successive distribution occupying {\textasciitilde}e\^{}-1 times the enclosed prior mass of the previous distribution. While NS technically requires independent generation of particles, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) exploration fits naturally into this technique. We illustrate the new method on a test problem and find that it can achieve four times the accuracy of classic MCMC-based Nested Sampling, for the same computational effort; equivalent to a factor of 16 speedup. An additional benefit is that more samples and a more accurate evidence value can be obtained simply by continuing the run for longer, as in standard MCMC.},

In a group of stars with individual spectral types from G2 to K7, the cycle periods were consistent with the relation P(cyc) is approximately equal to (P rot/tauc) exp n, where tauc is the convective turnover time near the bottom of the convection zone. On the basis of the above relations, it is suggested that an increase of P(cyc) with increasing P(rot) does not agree with conventional estimates from nonlinear dynamo models, and is limited by two factors: the quenching of the alpha effect; and differential rotation.},

  title = {Metal loading of giant gas planets},
  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5261},
  abstract = {One of many challenges in forming giant gas planets via Gravitational disc Instability model (GI) is an inefficient radiative cooling of the pre-collapse fragments. Since fragment contraction times are as long at \$10\^{}5 -10\^{}7\$ years, the fragments may be tidally destroyed sooner than they contract into gas giant planets. Here we explore the role of "pebble accretion" onto the pre-collapse giant planets and find an unexpected result. Despite larger dust opacity at higher metallicities, addition of metals actually accelerates -- rather than slows down -- collapse of high opacity, relatively low mass giant gas planets (\$M\_p\$ below a few Jupiter masses). A simple analytical theory that explains this result exactly in idealised simplified cases is presented. The theory shows that planets with the central temperature in the range between \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 1000 to 2000K are especially sensitive to pebble accretion: addition of just \${\textbackslash}sim 5\$ to 10 \% of metals by weight is sufficient to cause their collapse. These results show that dust grain physics and dynamics is essential for an accurate modelling of self-gravitating disc fragments and their near environments in the outer massive and cold protoplanetary discs.},

We include the recent Keck/HIRES measurements as well as the aged but much more numerous CORALIE data. We find that the CORALIE radial velocity measurements are polluted by a systematic annual variation which affected the robustness of many previous results. We show that after purging this variation, the residuals still contain a clear signature of an additional \${\textbackslash}sim 1100\$ days periodicity. The latter variation leaves significant hints in all three independent radial velocity subsets that we analysed: the CORALIE data, the Keck data acquired prior to a hardware upgrade, and the Keck data taken after the upgrade. We mainly treat this variation as a signature of a third planet in the system, although we cannot rule out other interpretations, such as long-term stellar activity. We find it easy to naturally obtain a stable three-planet radial-velocity fit close to the three-planet mean-motion resonance 1:2:5, with the two main planets (those in the 1:2 resonance) in an aligned apsidal corotation. The dynamical status of the third planet is still uncertain: it may reside in as well as slightly out of the 5:2 resonance. We obtain the value of \${\textbackslash}sim 1075\$ days for its orbital period and of \${\textbackslash}sim 0.3 M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$ for its minimum mass, while the eccentric parameters are uncertain.},

  abstract = {The quest for Earth-like planets is a major focus of current exoplanet research. Although planets that are Earth-sized and smaller have been detected, these planets reside in orbits that are too close to their host star to allow liquid water on their surfaces. We present the detection of Kepler-186f, a 1.11 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.14 Earth-radius planet that is the outermost of five planets, all roughly Earth-sized, that transit a 0.47 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.05 solar-radius star. The intensity and spectrum of the star's radiation place Kepler-186f in the stellar habitable zone, implying that if Kepler-186f has an Earth-like atmosphere and water at its surface, then some of this water is likely to be in liquid form.
Starry Brightness
The high photometric precision of NASA's Kepler observatory has enabled the detection of many planets because they cause slight dimming of their host stars as they orbit in front of them. From these data, Quintana et al. (p. 277) have spotted a five-planet system around a small star. Here, the outermost planet is only 10\% larger than Earth and completes its 130-day orbit entirely within the habitable zone, where liquid water could exist on its surface. Similarly, Kepler can detect faint periodic brightenings, as Kruse and Agol (p. 275) have reported for the binary system KOI-3278. In this system, a white dwarf acts as a gravitational microlens when it passes in front of its Sun-like G-star companion every 88 days. The lensing effect allows the mass of the white dwarf to be estimated, which helps us to understand how similar binary systems may have evolved.},

We then discuss the properties of the currently known distribution, using the mass-period diagram as a guide to delineating hot Jupiters, eccentric giant planets, and a third, highly populous, category that we term "ungiants", planets having masses less than 30 Earth masses and orbital periods less than 100 days. We then move to a discussion of the bulk compositions of the extrasolar planets. We discuss the long-standing problem of radius anomalies among giant planets, as well as issues posed by the unexpectedly large range in sizes observed for planets with masses somewhat greater than Earth's. We discuss the use of transit observations to probe the atmospheres of extrasolar planets; various measurements taken during primary transit, secondary eclipse, and through the full orbital period, can give clues to the atmospheric compositions, structures, and meteorologies. The extrasolar planet catalog, along with the details of our solar system and observations of star-forming regions and protoplanetary disks, provide a backdrop for a discussion of planet formation in which we review the elements of the favored pictures for how the terrestrial and giant planets were assembled. We conclude by listing several research questions that are relevant to the next ten years and beyond.},

  abstract = {The growth and composition of Earth is a direct consequence of planet formation throughout the Solar System. We discuss the known history of the Solar System, the proposed stages of growth and how the early stages of planet formation may be dominated by pebble growth processes. Pebbles are small bodies whose strong interactions with the nebula gas lead to remarkable new accretion mechanisms for the formation of planetesimals and the growth of planetary embryos. Many of the popular models for the later stages of planet formation are presented. The classical models with the giant planets on fixed orbits are not consistent with the known history of the Solar System, fail to create a high Earth/Mars mass ratio, and, in many cases, are also internally inconsistent. The successful Grand Tack model creates a small Mars, a wet Earth, a realistic asteroid belt and the mass-orbit structure of the terrestrial planets. In the Grand Tack scenario, growth curves for Earth most closely match a Weibull model. The feeding zones, which determine the compositions of Earth and Venus follow a particular pattern determined by Jupiter, while the feeding zones of Mars and Theia, the last giant impactor on Earth, appear to randomly sample the terrestrial disk. The late accreted mass samples the disk nearly evenly.},

  abstract = {No true extrasolar Earth analog is known. Hundreds of planets have been 
found around Sun-like stars that are either Earth-sized but on shorter
periods, or else on year-long orbits but somewhat larger. Under strong
assumptions, exoplanet catalogs have been used to make an extrapolated
estimate of the rate at which Sun-like stars host Earth analogs. These
studies are complicated by the fact that every catalog is censored by
non-trivial selection effects and detection efficiencies, and every
property (period, radius, etc.) is measured noisily. Here we present a
general hierarchical probabilistic framework for making justified
inferences about the population of exoplanets, taking into account
survey completeness and, for the first time, observational
uncertainties. We are able to make fewer assumptions about the
distribution than previous studies; we only require that the occurrence
rate density be a smooth function of period and radius (employing a
Gaussian process). By applying our method to synthetic catalogs, we
demonstrate that it produces more accurate estimates of the whole
population than standard procedures based on weighting by inverse
detection efficiency. We apply the method to an existing catalog of
small planet candidates around G dwarf stars. We confirm a previous
result that the radius distribution changes slope near Earth's radius.
We find that the rate density of Earth analogs is about 0.02 (per star
per natural logarithmic bin in period and radius) with large
uncertainty. This number is much smaller than previous estimates made
with the same data but stronger assumptions.},

  abstract = {Context. Planetary companions of a fixed mass induce larger amplitude reflex motions around lower-mass stars, which helps make M dwarfs excellent targets for extra-solar planet searches. State of the art velocimeters with \${\textbackslash}sim\$1m/s stability can detect very low-mass planets out to the habitable zone of these stars. Low-mass, small, planets are abundant around M dwarfs, and most known potentially habitable planets orbit one of these cool stars. Aims. Our M-dwarf radial velocity monitoring with HARPS on the ESO 3.6m telescope at La Silla observatory makes a major contribution to this sample. Methods. We present here dense radial velocity (RV) time series for three M dwarfs observed over \${\textbackslash}sim5\$ years: GJ 3293 (0.42M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), GJ 3341 (0.47M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), and GJ 3543 (0.45M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$). We extract those RVs through minimum \${\textbackslash}chi\^{}2\$ matching of each spectrum against a high S/N ratio stack of all observed spectra for the same star. We then vet potential orbital signals against several stellar activity indicators, to disentangle the Keplerian variations induced by planets from the spurious signals which result from rotational modulation of stellar surface inhomogeneities and from activity cycles. Results. Two Neptune-mass planets - \$msin(i)=1.4{\textbackslash}pm0.1\$ and \$1.3{\textbackslash}pm0.1M\_\{nept\}\$ - orbit GJ 3293 with periods \$P=30.60{\textbackslash}pm0.02\$ d and \$P=123.98{\textbackslash}pm0.38\$ d, possibly together with a super-Earth - \$msin(i){\textbackslash}sim7.9{\textbackslash}pm1.4M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ - with period \$P=48.14{\textbackslash}pm0.12{\textbackslash};d\$. A super-Earth - \$msin(i){\textbackslash}sim6.1M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ - orbits GJ 3341 with \$P=14.207{\textbackslash}pm0.007{\textbackslash};d\$.

We re-observed CoRoT-7 in 2012 January with both HARPS and CoRoT, so that we now have the benefit of simultaneous radial-velocity and photometric data. This allows us to use the off-transit variations in the star's light curve to estimate the radial-velocity variations induced by the suppression of convective blueshift and the flux blocked by starspots. To account for activity-related effects in the radial velocities which do not have a photometric signature, we also include an additional activity term in the radial-velocity model, which we treat as a Gaussian process with the same covariance properties (and hence the same frequency structure) as the light curve. Our model was incorporated into a Monte Carlo Markov Chain in order to make a precise determination of the orbits of CoRoT-7b and CoRoT-7c. We measure the masses of planets b and c to be 4.73 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.95 and 13.56 \ensuremath{\pm} 1.08
M\ensuremath{\oplus}, respectively. The density of CoRoT-7b is (6.61
\ensuremath{\pm} 1.72)(Rp/1.58 R\ensuremath{\oplus})-3 g
cm-3, which is compatible with a rocky composition. We search for evidence of an additional planet d, identified by previous authors with a period close to 9 d. We are not able to confirm the existence of a planet with this orbital period, which is close to the second harmonic of the stellar rotation at {\texttildelow}7.9 d. Using Bayesian model selection, we find that a model with two planets plus activity-induced variations is most favoured.},

According to this model, gas giants formed and acquired their mass
Mp through planetesimal coagulation followed by the emergence
of cores onto which gas is accreted. These protoplanets migrate and
attain their asymptotic semimajor axis a through tidal interaction with
their nascent disk. Based on the observed properties of protostellar
disks, we generate an Mp-a distribution. Our results
reproduce the observed lack of planets with intermediate mass

mass Mp\ensuremath{>}{\textasciitilde}103 M\ensuremath{\oplus} and a\ensuremath{<}{\textasciitilde}0.2

evaluate the metallicity dependence of the fraction of stars harboring
planets that are detectable with current radial velocity surveys. If
protostellar disks attain the same fraction of heavy elements as
contained in their host stars, the detection probability around
metal-rich stars would be greatly enhanced because protoplanetary cores
formed in them can grow to several Earth masses prior to their
depletion. These large masses are required for the cores to initiate
rapid gas accretion and to transform into giant planets. The
theoretically extrapolated metallicity dependence is consistent with the
observations. This correlation does not arise naturally in the
gravitational-instability scenario. We also suggest other metallicity
dependences of the planet distributions that can be tested by ongoing
observations.},

and confirmed with radial velocity follow-up observations from
Keck-HIRES. The mass of the planet was measured with a precision of
around 30\%, which was insufficient to constrain models of its internal
structure and composition in detail. In addition to Kepler-10b, a second
planet transiting the same star with a period of 45 days was
statistically validated, but the radial velocities were only good enough
to set an upper limit of 20 M \ensuremath{\oplus} for the mass of
Kepler-10c. To improve the precision on the mass for planet b, the
HARPS-N Collaboration decided to observe Kepler-10 intensively with the
HARPS-N spectrograph on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo on La Palma. In
total, 148 high-quality radial-velocity measurements were obtained over
two observing seasons. These new data allow us to improve the precision
of the mass determination for Kepler-10b to 15\%. With a mass of 3.33
\ensuremath{\pm} 0.49 M \ensuremath{\oplus} and an updated radius of
1.47\^{}\{+0.03\}\_\{-0.02\} R \ensuremath{\oplus}, Kepler-10b has a density of
5.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.8 g cm-3, very close to the value
predicted by models with the same internal structure and composition as
the Earth. We were also able to determine a mass for the 45-day period
planet Kepler-10c, with an even better precision of 11\%. With a mass of
17.2 \ensuremath{\pm} 1.9 M \ensuremath{\oplus} and radius of
2.35\^{}\{+0.09\}\_\{-0.04\} R \ensuremath{\oplus}, Kepler-10c has a density of
7.1 \ensuremath{\pm} 1.0 g cm-3. Kepler-10c appears to be the
first strong evidence of a class of more massive solid planets with
longer orbital periods.

  title = {Maximum entropy detection of planets around active stars},
  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00180},
  abstract = {(shortened for arXiv) We aim to progress towards more efficient exoplanet detection around active stars by optimizing the use of Doppler Imaging in radial velocity measurements. We propose a simple method to simultaneously extract a brightness map and a set of orbital parameters through a tomographic inversion technique derived from classical Doppler mapping. Based on the maximum entropy principle, the underlying idea is to determine the set of orbital parameters that minimizes the information content of the resulting Doppler map. We carry out a set of numerical simulations to perform a preliminary assessment of the robustness of our method, using an actual Doppler map of the very active star HR 1099 to produce a realistic synthetic data set for various sets of orbital parameters of a single planet in a circular orbit. Using a simulated time-series of 50 line profiles affected by a peak-to-peak activity jitter of 2.5 km/s, we are able in most cases to recover the radial velocity amplitude, orbital phase and orbital period of an artificial planet down to a radial velocity semi-amplitude of the order of the radial velocity scatter due to the photon noise alone (about 50 m/s in our case). One noticeable exception occurs when the planetary orbit is close to co-rotation, in which case significant biases are observed in the reconstructed radial velocity amplitude, while the orbital period and phase remain robustly recovered. The present method constitutes a very simple way to extract orbital parameters from heavily distorted line profiles of active stars, when more classical radial velocity detection methods generally fail. It is easily adaptable to most existing Doppler Imaging codes, paving the way towards a systematic search for close-in planets orbiting young, rapidly-rotating stars.},

  abstract = {The Kepler Mission, combined with ground based radial velocity (RV) follow-up and dynamical analyses of transit timing variations, has revolutionized the observational constraints on sub-Neptune-size planet compositions. The results of an extensive Kepler follow-up program including multiple Doppler measurements for 22 planet-hosting stars more than doubles the population of sub-Neptune-sized transiting planets that have RV mass constraints. This unprecedentedly large and homogeneous sample of planets with both mass and radius constraints opens the possibility of a statistical study of the underlying population of planet compositions. We focus on the intriguing transition between rocky exoplanets (comprised of iron and silicates) and planets with voluminous layers of volatiles (H/He and astrophysical ices). Applying a hierarchical Bayesian statistical approach to the sample of Kepler transiting sub-Neptune planets with Keck RV follow-up, we constrain the fraction of close-in planets (with orbital periods less than {\textasciitilde}50 days) that are sufficiently dense to be rocky, as a function of planet radius. We show that the majority of 1.6 Earth-radius planets are too low density to be comprised of Fe and silicates alone. At larger radii, the constraints on the fraction of rocky planets are even more stringent. These insights into the size demographics of rocky and volatile-rich planets offer empirical constraints to planet formation theories, and guide the range of planet radii to be considered in studies of the occurrence rate of "Earth-like" planets, \${\textbackslash}eta\_\{Earth\}\$.},

The algorithm analyses all suspicious periodicities that can be revealed, including the ones that look like an alias or noise at a glance, but later may prove to be a real variation. After selection of the initial candidates, the algorithm performs a complete pass through all their possible combinations and computes the rigorous multifrequency statistical significance for each such frequency tuple. The largest combinations that still survived this thresholding procedure represent the outcome of the analysis. The parallel computing on a graphics processing unit (GPU) is implemented through CUDA and brings a significant performance increase. It is still possible to run FREDEC solely on CPU in the traditional single-threaded mode, when no suitable GPU device is available. To verify the practical applicability of our algorithm, we apply it to an artificial time series as well as to some real-life exoplanetary radial-velocity data. We demonstrate that FREDEC can successfully reveal several known exoplanets. Moreover, it detected a new \$9.8\$-day variation in the Lick data for the five-planet system of 55 Cnc. It might indicate the existence of a small sixth planet in the 3:2 commensurability with the planet 55 Cnc b, although this detection is model-dependent and still needs a detailed verification.},

  title = {Fast Bayesian Inference for Exoplanet Discovery in Radial Velocity Data},
  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06952},
  abstract = {Inferring the number of planets \$N\$ in an exoplanetary system from radial velocity (RV) data is a challenging task. Recently, it has become clear that RV data can contain periodic signals due to stellar activity, which can be difficult to distinguish from planetary signals. However, even doing the inference under a given set of simplifying assumptions (e.g. no stellar activity) can be difficult. It is common for the posterior distribution for the planet parameters, such as orbital periods, to be multimodal and to have other awkward features. In addition, when \$N\$ is unknown, the marginal likelihood (or evidence) as a function of \$N\$ is required. Rather than doing separate runs with different trial values of \$N\$, we propose an alternative approach using a trans-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method within Nested Sampling. The posterior distribution for \$N\$ can be obtained with a single run. We apply the method to \${\textbackslash}nu\$ Oph and Gliese 581, finding moderate evidence for additional signals in \${\textbackslash}nu\$ Oph with periods of 36.11 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.034 days, 75.58 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.80 days, and 1709 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 183 days; the posterior probability that at least one of these exists is 85\%. The results also suggest Gliese 581 hosts many (7-15) "planets" (or other causes of other periodic signals), but only 4-6 have well determined periods. The analysis of both of these datasets shows phase transitions exist which are difficult to negotiate without Nested Sampling.},

  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07585},
  abstract = {Core Accretion (CA), the de-facto accepted theory of planet formation, requires formation of massive solid cores as a prerequisite for assembly of gas giant planets. The observed metallicity correlations of exoplanets are puzzling in the context of CA. While gas giant planets are found preferentially around metal-rich host stars, planets smaller than Neptune orbit hosts with a wide range of metallicities. We propose an alternative interpretation of these observations in the framework of a recently developed planet formation hypothesis called Tidal Downsizing (TD). We perform population synthesis calculations based on TD, and find that the connection between the populations of the gas giant and the smaller solid-core dominated planets is non linear and not even monotonic. While gas giant planets formed in the simulations in the inner few AU region follow a strong positive correlation with the host star metallicity, the smaller planets do not. The simulated population of these smaller planets shows a shallow peak in their formation efficiency at around the Solar metallicity. This result is driven by the fact that at low metallicities the solid core's growth is damped by the scarcity of metals, whereas at high metallicities the fragments within which the cores grow contract too quickly, cutting the core's growth time window short. Finally, simulated giant gas planets do not show a strong host star metallicity preference at large separations, which may explain why one of the best known directly imaged gas giant planet systems, HR 8799, is metal poor.},

  abstract = {Context. Searching for extrasolar planets through radial velocity measurements relies on the stability of stellar photospheres. Aims. We aim at characterizing the statistical properties of magnetic activity cycles, and studying their impact on spectroscopic measurements such as radial velocities, line bisectors and line shapes. Methods. We use data from the HARPS high-precision planet-search sample comprising 304 FGK stars followed over about 7 years. We obtain high-precision Ca II H\&K chromospheric activity measurements and convert them to R'HK indices using an updated calibration taking into account stellar metallicity. We study R'HK variability as a function of time and search for possible correlations with radial velocities and line shape parameters. Results. We classify stars according to the magnitude and timescale of the Ca II H\&K variability, and identify activity cycles whenever possible. We find that 39+/-8\% of old solar-type stars in the solar neighborhood do not show any activity cycles (or only very weak ones), while 61+/-8\% do have one. Non-cycling stars are almost only found among G dwarfs and at mean activity levels log R'HK \ensuremath{<} -4.95. Magnetic cycle amplitude generally decreases with decreasing activity level. A significant fraction of stars exhibit small variations in radial velocities and line shape parameters that are correlated with activity cycles. The sensitivity of radial velocities to magnetic cycles increases towards hotter stars, while late K dwarfs are almost insensitive. Conclusions. Activity cycles do induce long-period, low-amplitude radial velocity variations, at levels up to {\textasciitilde}25 m/s. Caution is therefore mandatory when searching for long-period exoplanets. However, these effects can be corrected to high precision by detrending the radial velocity data using simultaneous measurements of Ca II H\&K flux and line shape parameters. (Abridged)},

  abstract = {We report the discovery of two super-Earth mass planets orbiting the nearby K0.5 dwarf HD 7924 which was previously known to host one small planet. The new companions have masses of 7.9 and 6.4 M\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, and orbital periods of 15.3 and 24.5 days. We perform a joint analysis of high-precision radial velocity data from Keck/HIRES and the new Automated Planet Finder Telescope (APF) to robustly detect three total planets in the system. We refine the ephemeris of the previously known planet using five years of new Keck data and high-cadence observations over the last 1.3 years with the APF. With this new ephemeris, we show that a previous transit search for the inner-most planet would have covered 70\% of the predicted ingress or egress times. Photometric data collected over the last eight years using the Automated Photometric Telescope shows no evidence for transits of any of the planets, which would be detectable if the planets transit and their compositions are hydrogen-dominated. We detect a long-period signal that we interpret as the stellar magnetic activity cycle since it is strongly correlated with the Ca II H and K activity index. We also detect two additional short-period signals that we attribute to rotationally-modulated starspots and a one month alias. The high-cadence APF data help to distinguish between the true orbital periods and aliases caused by the window function of the Keck data. The planets orbiting HD 7924 are a local example of the compact, multi-planet systems that the Kepler Mission found in great abundance.},

  abstract = {High-precision radial velocity planet searches have surveyed over {\textasciitilde}2000 nearby stars and detected over {\textasciitilde}200 planets. While these same stars likely harbor many additional planets, they will become increasingly challenging to detect, as they tend to have relatively small masses and/or relatively long orbital periods. Therefore, observers are increasing the precision of their observations, continuing to monitor stars over decade timescales, and also preparing to survey thousands more stars. Given the considerable amounts of telescope time required for such observing programs, it is important to use the available resources as efficiently as possible. Previous studies have found that a wide range of predetermined scheduling algorithms results in planet searches with similar sensitivities. We have developed adaptive scheduling algorithms which have a solid basis in Bayesian inference and information theory and also are computationally feasible for modern planet searches. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations of plausible planet searches to test the power of adaptive scheduling algorithms. Our simulations demonstrate that planet searches performed with adaptive scheduling algorithms can simultaneously detect more planets, detect less massive planets, and measure orbital parameters more accurately than comparable surveys using a non-adaptive scheduling algorithm. We expect that these techniques will be particularly valuable for the N2K radial velocity planet search for short-period planets as well as future astrometric planet searches with the Space Interferometry Mission, which aim to detect terrestrial-mass planets.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of Spitzer/IRAC primary transit and secondary eclipse lightcurves measured for HD209458b, using Gaussian process models to marginalise over the intrapixel sensitivity variations in the 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron channels and the ramp effect in the 5.8 micron and 8.0 micron channels. The main advantage of this approach is that we can account for a broad range of degeneracies between the planet signal and systematics without actually having to specify a deterministic functional form for the latter. Our results do not confirm a previous claim of water absorption in transmission. Instead, our results are more consistent with a featureless transmission spectrum, possibly due to a cloud deck obscuring molecular absorption bands. For the emission data, our values are not consistent with the thermal inversion in the dayside atmosphere that was originally inferred from these data. Instead, we agree with another re-analysis of these same data, which concluded a non-inverted atmosphere provides a better fit. We find that a solar-abundance clear-atmosphere model without a thermal inversion underpredicts the measured emission in the 4.5 micron channel, which may suggest the atmosphere is depleted in carbon monoxide. An acceptable fit to the emission data can be achieved by assuming that the planet radiates as an isothermal blackbody with a temperature of \$1484{\textbackslash}pm 18\$ K.},

Aims: Detection limit methods must take into account the temporal

methods must also be able to be applied to large samples of stellar RV
time series Methods: We describe new methods for providing
detection limits. We compute the detection limits for a sample of ten
main-sequence stars, which are of G-F-A type, in general active, and/or
with detected planets and various properties. We use them to compare the
performances of these methods with those of two other methods used in
the litterature. Results: We obtained detection limits in the
2-1000 day period range for ten stars. Two of the proposed methods,
based on the correlation between periodograms and the power in the
periodogram of the RV time series in specific period ranges, are robust
and represent a significant improvement compared to a method based on
the root mean square of the RV signal. Conclusions: We conclude
that two of the new methods (correlation-based method and local power
analysis, i.e. LPA, method) provide robust detection limits, which are
better than those provided by methods that do not take into account the

  abstract = {Context. The detection of reflected light from an exoplanet is a 
difficult technical challenge at optical wavelengths. Even though this
signal is expected to replicate the stellar signal, not only is it
several orders of magnitude fainter, but it is also hidden among the
stellar noise. Aims: We apply a variant of the cross-correlation
technique to HARPS observations of 51 Peg to detect the reflected signal
from planet 51 Peg b. Methods: Our method
makes use of the cross-correlation function (CCF) of a binary mask with
high-resolution spectra to amplify the minute planetary signal that is
present in the spectra by a factor proportional to the number of
spectral lines when performing the cross correlation. The resulting
cross-correlation functions are then normalized by a stellar template to
remove the stellar signal. Carefully selected sections of the resulting
normalized CCFs are stacked to increase the planetary signal further.
The recovered signal allows probing several of the planetary properties,
including its real mass and albedo. Results: We detect evidence
for the reflected signal from planet 51 Peg b at a
significance of 3sigmanoise. The detection of the signal
permits us to infer a real mass of 0.46+0.06-0.01

the planet and an orbital inclination of 80+10-19
degrees. The analysis of the data also allows us to infer a tentative
value for the (radius-dependent) geometric albedo of the planet. The
results suggest that 51Peg b may be an inflated hot
Jupiter with a high albedo (e.g., an albedo of 0.5 yields a radius of
1.9 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.3 RJup for a signal amplitude of 6.0 \ensuremath{\pm}
0.4 {\texttimes} 10-5). Conclusions: We confirm that the
method we perfected can be used to retrieve an exoplanet's reflected
signal, even with current observing facilities. The advent of next
generation of instruments (e.g. VLT-ESO/ESPRESSO) and observing
facilities (e.g. a new generation of ELT telescopes) will yield new
opportunities for this type of technique to probe deeper into exoplanets
and their atmospheres.

  abstract = {Aims:It is known that stellar activity may complicate the analysis of 
high-precision radial-velocity spectroscopic data when looking for
exoplanets signatures. We aim at quantifying the impact of stellar spots
on stars with various spectral types and rotational velocities and
comparing the simulations with data obtained with the HARPS
spectrograph. Methods: We have developed detailed simulations of
stellar spots and estimated their effects on a number of observables
commonly used in the analysis of radial-velocity data when looking for
extrasolar planets, such as radial-velocity curves, cross-correlation
functions, bisector velocity spans, and photometric curves. Stellar and
spot properties are taken into account, as well as the characteristics
of the spectrograph used (generally HARPS). The computed stellar spectra
are then analyzed in the same way as when searching for exoplanets. Results: 1) A first grid of simulation results (radial-velocity
amplitudes, bisector velocity-span amplitudes and shapes, and
photometry) is built for F-K type stars, with different stellar and spot
properties. 2) It is shown quantitatively that star spots with typical
sizes of 1\% can mimic both radial-velocity curves and the bisector
behavior of short-period giant planets around G-K type stars with a v
sin\{i\} lower than the spectrograph resolution. For stars with
intermediate v sin\{i\}, smaller spots may produce similar features. Such
spots may complicate the search for low-mass planets on short-period
orbits. In these cases, additional observables (e.g., photometry,
spectroscopic diagnostics) are mandatory to confirm the presence of
short-period planets. We discuss these possibilities and show that, in
some cases, photometric variations may not be enough to clearly rule out
spots as explanations of the observed radial-velocity variations. This
is particularly important when searching for super-Earth planets. 3) It
is also stressed that quantitative values obtained for radial-velocity
and bisector velocity-span amplitudes depend strongly on the detailed
star properties, on the spectrograph used, on the line or set of lines
used, and on the way they are measured. High-resolution spectrographs
will help in distinguishing between spots and planets.

  abstract = {Aims: Extra-solar planet search programs require high-precision velocity measurements. They need to determine how to differentiate between radial-velocity variations due to Doppler motion and the noise induced by stellar activity. Methods: We monitored the active K2V star HD 189 733 and its transiting planetary companion, which has a 2.2-day orbital period. We used the high-resolution spectograph SOPHIE mounted on the 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence to obtain 55 spectra of HD 189 733 over nearly two months. We refined the HD 189 733b orbit parameters and placed limits on both the eccentricity and long-term velocity gradient. After subtracting the orbital motion of the planet, we compared the variability in spectroscopic activity indices with the evolution in the radial-velocity residuals and the shape of spectral lines. Results: The radial velocity, the spectral-line profile, and the activity indices measured in He I (5875.62 {\AA}),
H\ensuremath{\alpha} (6562.81 {\AA}), and both of the Ca II H\&K lines (3968.47
{\AA} and 3933.66 {\AA}, respectively) exhibit a periodicity close
to the stellar-rotation period and the correlations between them are consistent with a spotted stellar surface in rotation. We used these correlations to correct for the radial-velocity jitter due to stellar activity. This results in achieving high precision in measuring the orbital parameters, with a semi-amplitude K = 200.56 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.88 m
s-1 and a derived planet mass of MP = 1.13 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.03 M\_Jup.

Different optimality criteria are discussed, basing on the Fisher, Shannon and Kullback-Leibler informations. Algorithms of optimal scheduling of RV observations for two important practical problems are considered. The first problem is finding the time for future observations to yield the maximum improvement of the precision of exoplanetary orbital parameters and masses. The second problem is finding the most favourable time for distinguishing alternative orbital fits (the scheduling of discriminating observations).
These methods of optimal planning are demonstrated to be potentially efficient for multiplanet extrasolar systems, in particular for resonant ones. In these cases, the optimal dates of observations are often concentrated in quite narrow time segments.},

  abstract = {As part of a national scientific network 'Pathways to Habitability' the formation of planets and the delivery of water onto these planets is a key question as water is essential for the development of life. In the first part of the paper we summarize the state of the art of planet formation - which is still under debate in the astronomical community - before we show our results on this topic. The outcome of our numerical simulations depends a lot on the choice of the initial distribution of planetesimals and planetary embryos after gas disappeared in the protoplanetary disk. We also take into account that some of these planetesimals of sizes in the order of the mass of the Moon already contained water; the quantity depends on the distance from the Sun - close-by bodies are dry, but starting from a distance of about 2 AU they can contain substantial amounts of water. We assume that the gas giants and terrestrial planets are already formed when we check the collisions of the small bodies containing water (in the order of a few percent) with the terrestrial planets. We thus are able to give an estimate of the respective contribution to the actual water content (of some Earth-oceans) in the mantle, in the crust and on the surface of Earth. In the second part we discuss in more detail how the formation of larger bodies after a collision may happen as the outcome depends on parameters like collision velocity, impact angle, and the materials involved. We present results obtained by SPH (Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics) simulations. We briefly describe this method and show different scenarios with respect to the formed bodies, possible fragmentation and the water content before and after the collision. In an appendix we discuss detection methods for extrasolar planets (close to 2000 such objects have been discovered so far).},

  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201321174},
  abstract = {Context. Exoplanet Doppler surveys are currently the most efficient 
means to detect low-mass companions to nearby stars. Among these stars,
the light M dwarfs provide the highest sensitivity to detect low-mass
exoplanet candidates. Evidence is accumulating that a substantial
fraction of these low-mass planets are found in high-multiplicity
planetary systems. GJ 163 is a nearby inactive M dwarf with abundant
public observations obtained using the HARPS spectrograph. Aims:
We obtain and analyse radial velocities from the HARPS public spectra of
GJ 163 and investigate the presence of a planetary companions orbiting
it. The number of planet candidates detected might depend on some prior
assumptions. Since the impact of prior choice has not been investigated
throughly previously, we study the effects of different prior densities
on the detectability of planet candidates around GJ 163. Methods:
We use Bayesian tools, i.e. posterior samplings and model comparisons,
when analysing the GJ 163 velocities. We consider models accounting for
the possible correlations of subsequent measurements. We also search for
activity-related counterparts of the signals we observe and test the
dynamical stability of the planetary systems corresponding to our
solutions using direct numerical integrations of the orbits. 
Results: We find that there are at least three planet candidates
orbiting GJ 163. The existence of a fourth planet is supported by the
data but the evidence in favor of the corresponding model is not yet
conclusive. The second innermost planet candidate in the system with an
orbital period of 25.6 days and a minimum mass of 8.7
M\ensuremath{\oplus} is inside the liquid-water habitable zone of the
star. Conclusions: The architecture of GJ 163 system resembles a
scaled-down Solar System in the sense that there are two low-mass
planets on orbital periods of 8.7 and 25.6 days in the inner system, a
possible slightly more massive companion on an intermediate orbit, and
an outer sub-Saturnian companion at roughly 1 AU. The discovery of (yet)
another planetary system with several low-mass companions around a
nearby M-dwarf indicates that the high-multiplicity planetary systems
found by the NASA Kepler mission around G and K dwarfs is also present
(possibly even reinforced) around low-mass stars.

The orbital fit to the combined McDonald and Lick data gives a period of 800.8 days, a velocity amplitude (K) of 43.9 m s-1, and an eccentricity of 0.63. This is the largest eccentricity of any planetary system discovered so far. Assuming that 16 Cygni B has a mass of 1.0 M\ensuremath{\odot}, the mass function then implies a mass for the companion of 1.5/sin i Jupiter masses. While the mass of this object is well within the range expected for planets, the large orbital
eccentricity cannot be explained simply by the standard model of growth of planets in a protostellar disk. It is possible that this object was formed in the normal manner with a low-eccentricity orbit and has undergone postformational orbital evolution, either through the same process that has been proposed to have formed the ``massive eccentric'' planets around 70 Virginis and HD 114762, or by gravitational

It is based on insights from a simple spot model, has only two free parameters (one of which can be estimated from the light curve) and does not require knowledge of the stellar rotation period. We test the method on simulated data and illustrate its performance by applying it to MOST/SOPHIE observations of the planet host-star HD189733, where it gives almost identical results to much more sophisticated, but highly degenerate models, and synthetic data for the Sun, where we demonstrate that it can reproduce variations well below the m/s level. We also apply it to Quarter 1 data for Kepler transit candidate host stars, where it can be used to estimate RV variations down to the 2-3m/s level, and show that RV amplitudes above that level may be expected for approximately two thirds of the candidates we examined.},

The hosts of shorter-period super-Earths are on average more metal-rich than those of longer-period super-Earths.

  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00762},
  abstract = {Accurate and repeated photometric follow-up observations of planetary-transit events are important to precisely characterize the physical properties of exoplanets. A good knowledge of the main characteristics of the exoplanets is fundamental to trace their origin and evolution. Multi-band photometric observations play an important role in this process. By using new photometric data, we computed precise estimates of the physical properties of two transiting planetary systems. We present new broad-band, multi-colour, photometric observations obtained using three small class telescopes and the telescope-defocussing technique. For each of the two targets, one transit event was simultaneously observed through four optical filters. One transit of WASP-48 b was monitored with two telescopes from the same observatory. The physical parameters of the systems were obtained by fitting the transit light curves with \{{\textbackslash}sc jktebop\} and from published spectroscopic measurements. We have revised the physical parameters of the two planetary systems, finding a smaller radius for both HAT-P-23 b and WASP-48 b, \$R\_\{b\}=1.224 {\textbackslash}pm 0.037 R\_\{Jup\}\$ and \$R\_\{b\}=1.396 {\textbackslash}pm 0.051 {\textbackslash}, R\_\{Jup\}\$, respectively, than those measured in the discovery papers (\$R\_\{b\}=1.368 {\textbackslash}pm 0.090 R\_\{Jup\}\$ and \$R\_\{b\}=1.67 {\textbackslash}pm 0.10 R\_\{Jup\}\$). The density of the two planets are higher than those previously published (\${\textbackslash}rho\_\{b\}\$ {\textasciitilde}1.1 and {\textasciitilde}0.3 \${\textbackslash}rho\_\{jup\}\$ for HAT-P-23 and WASP-48 respectively) hence the two Hot Jupiters are no longer located in a parameter space region of highly inflated planets. An analysis of the variation of the planet's measured radius as a function of optical wavelength reveals flat transmission spectra within the experimental uncertainties. We also confirm the presence of the eclipsing contact binary NSVS-3071474 in the same field of view of WASP-48, for which we refine the value of the period to be 0.459 d.},

  abstract = {Direct imaging has only begun to inventory the population of gas giant 
planets on wide orbits around young stars in the solar neighborhood.
Following this approach, we carried out a deep imaging survey in the
near-infrared using VLT/NaCo to search for substellar companions. Here
we report the discovery of a probable companion orbiting the young
(10-17 Myr), dusty, early-type (A8) star HD 95086 at 56 AU in L' (3.8
\ensuremath{\mu}m) images. This discovery is based on observations with more than a
year time lapse. Our first epoch clearly revealed the source at {\textasciitilde}=
10\ensuremath{\sigma}, while our second epoch lacks good observing conditions,
yielding a {\textasciitilde}= 3\ensuremath{\sigma} detection. Various tests were thus made to rule
out possible artifacts. This recovery is consistent with the signal at
the first epoch but requires cleaner confirmation. Nevertheless, our
astrometric precision suggests that the companion is comoving with the
star with a 3\ensuremath{\sigma} confidence level. The planetary nature of the
source is reinforced by a non-detection in the Ks-band (2.18 \ensuremath{\mu}m)
images according to its possible extremely red Ks-L' color. Conversely,
background contamination is rejected with good confidence level. The
luminosity yields a predicted mass of about 4-5 M Jup (at
10-17 Myr) using "hot-start" evolutionary models, making HD 95086 b the
exoplanet with the lowest mass ever imaged around a star.

Assuming Keplerian orbits, the two-companion model is found to be e48 times more probable than the one-planet model, although the orbital parameters of the second companion are only weakly constrained. The derived orbital periods are 345.6 \ensuremath{\pm} 2.0 and 9017.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 3180.7 d, respectively, and the
corresponding eccentricities are 0.54 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.04 and 0.14 \ensuremath{\pm}

\ensuremath{\pm} 10.55MJ, 7.70 \ensuremath{\pm} 1.88 au), respectively. Owing
to the large uncertainty on the mass of the second companion, we are unable to determine whether it is a planet or a brown dwarf. The remaining 'noise' (stellar jitter) unaccounted for by the model is 2.28 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.31 m s-1. We also analysed a three-companion

Individual solar cycles are characterized by their maxima and minima, cycle periods and amplitudes, cycle shape, the equatorward drift of the active latitudes, hemispheric asymmetries, and active longitudes. Cycle-to-cycle variability includes the Maunder Minimum, the Gleissberg Cycle, and the Gnevyshev-Ohl (even-odd) Rule.

  abstract = {We determine the true and the projected obliquity of HAT-P-36 and WASP-11/HAT-P-10 systems, respectively, which are both composed of a relatively cool star and a hot-Jupiter planet. Thanks to the high-resolution spectrograph HARPS-N, we observed the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for both the systems by acquiring precise radial-velocity measurements during planetary transit events. We also present photometric observations comprising six light curves covering five transit events, obtained using three medium-class telescopes and the telescope-defocussing technique. One transit of WASP-11/HAT-P-10 was followed contemporaneously from two observatories. The three transit light curves of HAT-P-36b show anomalies attributable to starspot complexes on the surface of the parent star, in agreement with the analysis of its spectra that indicate a moderate activity. By analysing the complete HATNet data set of HAT-P-36, we estimated the stellar rotation period by detecting a periodic photometric modulation in the light curve caused by star spots, obtaining Prot=15.3 days, which implies that the inclination of the stellar rotational axis with respect to the line of sight is 65 degree. We used the new spectroscopic and photometric data to revise the main physical parameters and measure the sky-projected misalignment angle of the two systems. We found {\textbackslash}lambda=-14 degree for HAT-P-36 and {\textbackslash}lambda=7 degree for WASP-11/HAT-P-10, indicating in both cases a good spin-orbit alignment. In the case of HAT-P-36, we also measured its real obliquity, which resulted to be 25 degrees.},

  abstract = {Two years ago a new benchmark for the planetary survey was set with the discoveries of three extrasolar planets with masses below 20 M\_\ensuremath{\oplus}. In particular, the serendipitous discovery of the 14 M\_\ensuremath{\oplus} planet
around \ensuremath{\mu} Ara found with HARPS with a semi-amplitude of only 4 m
s-1 put in evidence the tremendous potential of HARPS for the search of this class of very low-mass planets. Aiming to discovering new worlds similar to \ensuremath{\mu} Ara b, we carried out an intensive campaign with HARPS to observe a selected sample of northern stars covering a range of metallicity from about solar to twice solar. Two stars in our program were found to present radial velocity variations compatible with the presence of a planet-mass companion. The first of these, HD 219828, was found to be orbited by a planet with a minimum mass of 19.8 M\_\ensuremath{\oplus}
and an orbital period of 3.83 days. It is the 11th Neptune-mass planet found so far orbiting a solar-type star. The radial velocity data clearly show the presence of an additional body to the system, likely of planetary mass. The second planet orbits HD 102195, has a mass of 0.45 M\_Jup and an orbital period of 4.11 days. This planet has been already announced by Ge et al. (2006, ApJ, 648, 683). Our data confirm and improve the orbital solution found by these authors. We also show that the high residuals of the orbital solution are caused by stellar activity, and use the bisectors of the HARPS cross-correlation function to correct the noise introduced by stellar activity. An improved orbital solution is obtained after this correction. This kind of analysis may be used in the future to correct the radial-velocities for stellar activity induced noise.

We compare the X-ray data with 17 years of V-band brightness monitoring that shows a 10-year decline between 1978 and 1989 and a subsequent rise phase. In contrast, the X-ray flux, which is very variable on time scales of minutes to weeks, exhibits no pronounced long-term trend over the 5 1/2-years of the program. This supports the concept of a saturated corona. Making use of the ROSAT all-sky survey data and data from the most extensive among the available pointed observations we also discuss the short-term variablity in relation to the rotational time scale. We find evidence for a partial rotational modulation of the X-ray flux implying structural inhomogeneities in this saturated corona.},

KOI-614b has a mass of \$2.86{\textbackslash}pm0.35{\textasciitilde}\{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{Jup\}\vphantom{\{}\}\$ and a radius of \$1.13\^{}\{+0.26\}\_\{-0.18\}{\textasciitilde}\{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}rm R\_\{Jup\}\vphantom{\{}\}\$, and it orbits a G0, metallic ({[}Fe/H{]}=\$0.35{\textbackslash}pm0.15\$) dwarf in 12.9 days. Its mass and radius are familiar and compatible with standard planetary evolution models, so it is one of the few known transiting planets in this mass range to have an orbital period over ten days. With an equilibrium temperature of \$T\_\{eq\}=1000 {\textbackslash}pm 45\$ K, this places KOI-614b at the transition between what is usually referred to as "hot" and "warm" Jupiters. KOI-206b has a mass of \$2.82{\textbackslash}pm 0.52{\textasciitilde}\{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{Jup\}\vphantom{\{}\}\$ and a radius of \$1.45{\textbackslash}pm0.16{\textasciitilde}\{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}rm R\_\{Jup\}\vphantom{\{}\}\$, and it orbits a slightly evolved F7-type star in a 5.3-day orbit. It is a massive inflated hot Jupiter that is particularly challenging for planetary models because it requires unusually large amounts of additional dissipated energy in the planet. On the other hand, KOI-680b has a much lower mass of \$0.84{\textbackslash}pm0.15{\textasciitilde}\{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{Jup\}\vphantom{\{}\}\$ and requires less extra-dissipation to explain its uncommonly large radius of \$1.99{\textbackslash}pm0.18{\textasciitilde}\{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}rm R\_\{Jup\}\vphantom{\{}\}\$. It is one of the biggest transiting planets characterized so far, and it orbits a subgiant F9-star well on its way to the red giant stage, with an orbital period of 8.6 days. With host stars of masses of \$1.46{\textbackslash}pm0.17{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and \$1.54 {\textbackslash}pm 0.09{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, respectively, KOI-206b, and KOI-680b are interesting objects for theories of formation and survival of short-period planets around stars more massive than the Sun. For those two targets, we also find signs of a possible distant additional companion in the system.},

Its major abilities include: (i) Advanced RV curve fitting with the proper maximum-likelihood treatment of unknown RV jitter; (ii) User-friendly multi-Keplerian as well as Newtonian \$N\$-body RV fits; (iii) Use of more efficient maximum-likelihood periodograms that involve the full multi-planet fitting (sometimes called as ``residual'' or ``recursive'' periodograms); (iv) Easily calculatable parametric 2D likelihood function level contours, reflecting the asymptotic confidence regions; (v) Fitting under some useful functional constraints is user-friendly; (vi) Basic tasks of short- and long-term planetary dynamical simulation using a fast Everhart-type integrator based on Gauss--Legendre spacings; (vii) Fitting the data with red noise (auto-correlated errors); (viii) Various analytical and numerical methods for the tasks of determining the statistical significance. It is planned that further functionality may be added to PlanetPack in the future. During the development of this software, a lot of effort was made to improve the calculational speed, especially for CPU-demanding tasks. PlanetPack was written in pure C++ (standard of 1998/2003), and is expected to be compilable and usable on a wide range of platforms.},

  abstract = {We re-analyse the recently published High-Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) and Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) velocities of the nearby K dwarf GJ 221 that have been reported to contain the signatures of two planets orbiting the star. Our goal is to see whether the earlier studies discussing the system fell victims of false negative detections. We perform the analyses by using an independent statistical method based on posterior samplings and model comparisons in the Bayesian framework that is known to be more sensitive to weak signals of low-mass planets. According to our analyses, we find strong evidence in favour of a third candidate planet in the system corresponding to a cold sub-Saturnian planet with an orbital period of 500 d and a minimum mass of 29 M\ensuremath{\oplus}. Application of sub-optimal signal detection methods can leave low-amplitude signals undetected in radial velocity time series. Our results suggest that the estimated statistical
properties of low-mass planets can thus be biased because several signals corresponding to low-mass candidate planets may have gone unnoticed. This also suggests that the occurrence rates of such planets based on radial velocity surveys might be underestimated. L31},

  abstract = {The metallicity of exoplanet systems serves as a critical diagnostic of planet formation mechanisms. Previous studies have demonstrated the planet-metallicity correlation for large planets (\$R\_P{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}geq{\textbackslash} 4{\textbackslash} R\_E\$); however, a correlation has not been found for smaller planets. With a sample of 406 \$Kepler\$ Objects of Interest whose stellar properties are determined spectroscopically, we reveal a universal planet-metallicity correlation: not only gas-giant planets (\$3.9{\textbackslash} R\_E{\textbackslash} \ensuremath{<} R\_P{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}leq{\textbackslash} 22.0{\textbackslash} R\_E\$) but also gas-dwarf (\$1.7{\textbackslash} R\_E{\textbackslash} \ensuremath{<} R\_P{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}leq{\textbackslash} 3.9{\textbackslash} R\_E\$) and terrestrial planets (\$R\_P{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}leq{\textbackslash} 1.7{\textbackslash} R\_E\$) occur more frequently in metal-rich stars. The planet occurrence rates of gas-giant planets, gas-dwarf planets, and terrestrial planets are \$9.30\^{}\{+5.62\}\_\{-3.04\}\$, \$2.03\^{}\{+0.29\}\_\{-0.26\}\$, and \$1.72\^{}\{+0.19\}\_\{-0.17\}\$ times higher for metal-rich stars than for metal-poor stars, respectively.},

  abstract = {There are a growing number of multi-planet systems known to be orbiting 
their host stars with orbital periods that place them in mean motion
resonances (MMRs). These systems are generally in first-order resonances
and dynamical studies have focused their efforts on understanding the
origin and evolution of such dynamically resonant commensurabilities.
Here we report the discovery of two super-Earths that are close to a
second-order dynamical resonance orbiting the metal-poor ({[}Fe/H{]} =
-0.43 dex) and inactive G2V star HD 41428. We analyzed 62 HARPS
archival radial velocities for this star that, until now, exhibited no
evidence for planetary companions. Using our new Bayesian Doppler signal
detection algorithm, we find two significant signals in the data, with
periods of 18.357 days and 25.648 days, indicating they could be part of
a 7:5 second-order MMR. Both semi-amplitudes are below 3 m
s-1 and the minimum masses of the pair are 12.3 and 8.6
M \ensuremath{\oplus}, respectively. Our simulations found that apsidal
alignment stabilizes the system, and even though libration of the
resonant angles was not seen, the system is affected by the presence of
the resonance and could still occupy the 7:5 commensurability, which
would be the first planetary configuration in such a dynamical
resonance. Given the multitude of low-mass multi-planet systems that
will be discovered in the coming years, we expect that more of these
second-order resonant configurations will emerge from the data,
highlighting the need for a better understanding of the dynamical
interactions between forming planetesimals.},

  abstract = {We present an inversion method based on Bayesian analysis to constrain the interior structure of terrestrial exoplanets, in the form of chemical composition of the mantle and core size. Specifically, we identify what parts of the interior structure of terrestrial exoplanets can be determined from observations of mass, radius, and stellar elemental abundances. We perform a full probabilistic inverse analysis to formally account for observational and model uncertainties and obtain confidence regions of interior structure models. This enables us to characterize how model variability depends on data and associated uncertainties. We test our method on terrestrial solar system planets and find that our model predictions are consistent with independent estimates. Furthermore, we apply our method to synthetic exoplanets up to 10 Earth masses and up to 1.7 Earth radii as well as to exoplanet Kepler-36b. Importantly, the inversion strategy proposed here provides a framework for understanding the level of precision required to characterize the interior of exoplanets. Our main conclusions are: (1) observations of mass and radius are sufficient to constrain core size; (2) stellar elemental abundances (Fe, Si, Mg) are key constraints to reduce degeneracy in interior structure models and to constrain mantle composition; (3) the inherent degeneracy in determining interior structure from mass and radius observations does not only depend on measurement accuracies but also on the actual size and density of the exoplanet. We argue that precise observations of stellar elemental abundances are central in order to place constraints on planetary bulk composition and to reduce model degeneracy. {[}...{]}},

  abstract = {Atmospheric properties of exoplanets can be constrained with transit spectroscopy. The signature of atomic sodium NaI, known to be present above the clouds, is a powerful probe of the upper atmosphere, where it can be best detected and characterized at high spectral resolution. Our goal is to obtain a high-resolution transit spectrum of HD189733b in the region around the resonance doublet of NaI at 589 nm, to characterize the absorption signature previously detected from space at low resolution. We analyze archival transit data of HD189733b obtained with the HARPS spectrograph. We retrieve the transit spectrum and light curve of the planet, implementing corrections for telluric contamination and planetary orbital motion. We spectrally resolve the NaI D doublet and measure line contrasts of \$0.64{\textbackslash}pm0.07{\textbackslash}\%\$ (D2) and \$0.40{\textbackslash}pm0.07{\textbackslash}\%\$ (D1) and FWHMs of \$0.52{\textbackslash}pm0.08{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}AA\$. This corresponds to a detection at the 10-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ level of excess of absorption of \$0.32{\textbackslash}pm0.03{\textbackslash}\%\$ in a passband of \$2{\textbackslash}times0.75{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}AA\$ centered on each line. We derive temperatures of \$2{\textbackslash},600{\textbackslash}pm600\$ K and \$3270{\textbackslash}pm330\$ K at altitudes of \$9{\textbackslash},800{\textbackslash}pm2{\textbackslash},800\$ km and \$12{\textbackslash},700{\textbackslash}pm2{\textbackslash},600\$ km in the NaI D1 and D2 line cores, respectively. We measure a temperature gradient of \${\textbackslash}sim0.2\$ K km\$\^{}\{-1\}\$ from comparison with theoretical models. We also detect a blueshift of \$0.16{\textbackslash}pm0.04{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}AA\$ (4 \${\textbackslash}sigma\$) in the line positions. This blueshift may be due to winds blowing at \$8{\textbackslash}pm2\$ km s\$\^{}\{-1\}\$ in the upper layers of the atmosphere. We demonstrate the relevance of studying exoplanet atmospheres with high-resolution spectrographs mounted on 4-meter-class telescopes. Our results pave the way towards in-depth characterization of physical conditions in the atmospheres of many exoplanetary systems with future spectrographs such as ESPRESSO on the VLT or HiReS and METIS on the E-ELT.},

  abstract = {Context. Stellar activity induces apparent radial velocity (RV) 
variations in late-type main-sequence stars that may hamper the
detection of low-mass planets and the measurement of their mass. 
Aims: We use simultaneous measurements of the active planet host star HD
189733 with high-precision optical photometry by the MOST satellite and
high-resolution spectra by SOPHIE. We apply on this unique dataset a
spot model to predict the activity-induced RV variations and compare
them with the observed ones. Methods: The model is based on the
rotational modulation of the stellar flux. A maximum entropy
regularization is applied to find a unique and stable solution for the
distribution of the active regions versus stellar longitude. The RV
variations are synthesized considering the effects on the line profiles
of the brightness perturbations due to dark spots and bright faculae and
the reduction of the convective blueshifts in the active regions. 
Results: The synthesized RV time series shows a remarkably good
agreement with the observed one although variations on timescales
shorter than 4-5 days cannot be reproduced by our model. Persistent
active longitudes are revealed by the spot modelling. They rotate with
slightly different periods yielding a minimum relative amplitude of the
differential rotation of \ensuremath{{\Delta}{\Omega}}/\ensuremath{\Omega} = 0.23 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.10.
Moreover, several active regions with an evolution timescale of 2-5 days
and an area of 0.1-0.3 percent of the stellar disc are detected. 
Conclusions: The method proves capable of reducing the power of the
activity-induced RV variations by a factor from 2 to 10 at the rotation
frequency and its harmonics up to the third. Thanks to the
high-precision space-borne photometry delivered by CoRoT, Kepler, or
later PLATO, it is possible to map the longitudinal distribution of
active regions in late-type stars and apply the method presented in this
paper to reduce remarkably the impact of stellar activity on their RV
jitter allowing us to confirm the detection of low-mass planets or
refine the measurement of their mass.},

  abstract = {This paper presents SOAP 2.0, a new version of the Spot Oscillation And 
Planet (SOAP) code that estimates in a simple way the photometric and
radial velocity (RV) variations induced by active regions. The
inhibition of the convective blueshift (CB) inside active regions is
considered, as well as the limb brightening effect of plages, a
quadratic limb darkening law, and a realistic spot and plage contrast
ratio. SOAP 2.0 shows that the activity-induced variation of plages is
dominated by the inhibition of the CB effect. For spots, this effect
becomes significant only for slow rotators. In addition, in the case of
a major active region dominating the activity-induced signal, the ratio
between the FWHM and the RV peak-to-peak amplitudes of the cross
correlation function can be used to infer the type of active region
responsible for the signal for stars with v sin i \ensuremath{<}=8 km
s{\textendash}1. A ratio smaller than three implies a spot, while a
larger ratio implies a plage. Using the observation of HD 189733, we
show that SOAP 2.0 manages to reproduce the activity variation as well
as previous simulations when a spot is dominating the activity-induced
variation. In addition, SOAP 2.0 also reproduces the activity variation
induced by a plage on the slowly rotating star \ensuremath{\alpha} Cen B, which is
not possible using previous simulations. Following these results, SOAP
2.0 can be used to estimate the signal induced by spots and plages, but
also to correct for it when a major active region is dominating the RV
variation.

  url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ASPC..185..259H},
  abstract = {Stellar surface structure in the form of cool spots create spectral distortions which can be detected as radial velocity (RV) variations that are modulated with the rotation period of the star. These RV variations act as ''noise'' which can obscure the RV signal due to planets. Here the predicted RV and line profile shape variations using realistic spot models and an RV ''measurement'' technique that mimics current methods are calculated for cool spots spanning a range of parameters pertinent to activity in solar-type stars (slow rotation, small spots). For a stars with the same projected rotational velocity as the Sun, the RV amplitude due to a spot comparable to the largest sunspot is about 3 m/s and is less than 1 m/s for a more modest sized starspot. These simulations also show the '' v sin i '' amplification effect; for a given spot size the RV amplitude increases linearly with v sin i. All of these findings confirm the results of Saar \& Donahue who also looked at activity related RV variations. The RV noise due to stellar activity will thus be higher in more rapidly rotating stars because 1) the RV amplitude is higher due to the v sin i amplification effect, and 2) stars with higher rotation tend to have more activity (more and larger spots). Searching for Saturn-like planets is best suited for those stars with v sin i \ensuremath{<} 3 km/s. The RV amplitude
increases linearly with spot filling factor and is about 7 m/s for a filling factor of 0.2\% and as high as 20 m/s for a filling factor of 1\% ( v sin i = 3 km/s) However, if spots are uniformly distributed about the equator, the RV noise due to sunspot-sized spots is always less than about 1 m/s. For modest rotations rates (v sin i = 15 km/s) temperature sensitive lines have an amplitude 15\% lower than temperature insensitive lines. An RV analysis of active stars as a function of temperature sensitive lines may help distinguish between RV signals due to spots and those due to companions. Restricting RV measurements to temperature sensitive lines (line strength increasing in the starspot) should also minimize RV noise due to stellar activity. Combining precise stellar radial velocity measurements with line shape information, one may be able to map spot features on slowly rotating stars for which the Doppler imaging technique is ill-suited.},

These new data confirm the planetary nature of the previously unconstrained long-period object in the HD 154857 system. We have performed detailed dynamical stability simulations which show that the HD 154857 two-planet system is stable on timescales of at least 108 yr. These results highlight the continued importance of legacy surveys with long observational baselines; these ongoing campaigns are critical for determining the population of Jupiter analogs, and hence of those planetary systems with architectures most like our own solar system.},

We measured increasing planet occurrence with decreasing planet mass (M). Extrapolation of a power-law mass distribution fitted to our measurements, df/dlogM = 0.39 M-0.48, predicts that 23\% of stars harbor a close-in Earth-mass planet (ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 Earth masses). Theoretical models of planet formation predict a deficit of planets in the domain from 5 to 30 Earth masses and with orbital periods less than 50 days. This region of parameter space is in fact well populated, implying that such models need substantial revision.},

(2010). The Bayesian analysis supports the hypothesis of a planetary companion. We present a new orbital solution after removing the two main contributions to the stellar jitter, one that varies with the photometric period and another that varies with the synodic period of the star+planet system. We use a new method to determine these jitter components, considering them as a second and third signals in the system. A discussion on possible magnetic star-planet-interaction is included, based on the Bayesian analysis of the activity indices. We propose two possible sources for flare events of this star: one related to the geometry of the system and the relative movement of the star+planet, and a second one purely stochastic source that is related to the evolution of stellar active regions. Also, we observe for the first time the magnetic field of the star, from spectropolarimetric data.},

Specifically, we examine five different kinds of periodicity metrics, which are based on non-parametric measures of serial dependence of the phase-folded data. We test the metrics through simulations in which we assess their performance in various situations, including various periodic signal shapes, different numbers of data points and different signal to noise ratios. One of the periodicity metrics we introduce seems to perform significantly better than the classical ones in some settings of interest to astronomers. We suggest that this periodicity metric - the Hoeffding-test periodicity metric - should be used in addition to the traditional methods, to increase periodicity detection probability.},

In order to infer the posterior probability distribution we have to decide how to explore parameter space. Here we compare three prescriptions for how parameter space is navigated, discussing their relative merits. We consider Metropolis-Hasting sampling, nested sampling and affine-invariant ensemble MCMC sampling. We focus on their performance on toy-model Gaussian likelihoods and on a real-world cosmological data set. We outline the sampling algorithms themselves and elaborate on performance diagnostics such as convergence time, scope for parallelisation, dimensional scaling, requisite tunings and suitability for non-Gaussian distributions. We find that nested sampling delivers high-fidelity estimates for posterior statistics at low computational cost, and should be adopted in favour of Metropolis-Hastings in many cases. Affine-invariant MCMC is competitive when computing clusters can be utilised for massive parallelisation. Affine-invariant MCMC and existing extensions to nested sampling naturally probe multi-modal and curving distributions.},

  abstract = {We present a survey of 41 Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) for exomoons using Bayesian photodynamics, more than tripling the number of KOIs surveyed with this technique. We find no compelling evidence for exomoons although thirteen KOIs yield spurious detections driven by instrumental artifacts, stellar activity and/or perturbations from unseen bodies. Regarding the latter, we find seven KOIs exhibiting \ensuremath{>}5 sigma evidence of transit timing variations, including the 'mega-Earth' Kepler-10c, likely indicating an additional planet in that system. We exploit the moderately large sample of 57 unique KOIs surveyed to date to infer several useful statistics. For example, although there is a diverse range in sensitivities, we find that we are sensitive to Pluto-Charon mass-ratio systems for {\textasciitilde}40\% of KOIs studied and Earth-Moon mass-ratios for 1 in 8 cases. In terms of absolute mass, our limits probe down to 1.7 Ganymede masses, with a sensitivity to Earth-mass moons for 1 in 3 cases studied and to the smallest moons capable of sustaining an Earth-like atmosphere (0.3 Earth masses) for 1 in 4. Despite the lack of positive detections to date, we caution against drawing conclusions yet, since our most interesting objects remain under analysis. Finally, we point out that had we searched for the photometric transit signals of exomoons alone, rather than using photodynamics, we estimate that 1 in 4 KOIs would have erroneously been concluded to harbor exomoons due to residual time correlated noise in the Kepler data, posing a serious problem for alternative methods.},

  abstract = {We report the detection of the first extrasolar planet, ET-1 (HD 
102195b), using the Exoplanet Tracker (ET), a new-generation Doppler
instrument. The planet orbits HD 102195, a young star with solar
metallicity that may be part of the local association. The planet
imparts radial velocity variability to the star with a semiamplitude of
63.4+/-2.0 m s-1 and a period of 4.11 days. The planetary
minimum mass (msini) is 0.488MJ+/-0.015MJ. The
planet was initially detected in the spring of 2005 with the Kitt Peak
National Observatory (KPNO) 0.9 m coud{\'e} feed telescope. The
detection was confirmed by radial velocity observations with the ET at
the KPNO 2.1 m telescope and also at the 9 m Hobby-Eberly Telescope
(HET) with its High Resolution Spectrograph. This planetary discovery
with a 0.9 m telescope around a V=8.05 magnitude star was made possible
by the high throughput of the instrument: 49\% measured from the fiber
output to the detector. The ET's interferometer-based approach is an
effective method for planet detection. In addition, the ET concept is
adaptable to multiple-object Doppler observations or very high precision
observations with a cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph to separate
stellar fringes over a broad wavelength band. In addition to
spectroscopic observations of HD 102195, we obtained brightness
measurements with one of the automated photometric telescopes at
Fairborn Observatory. Those observations reveal that HD 102195 is a
spotted variable star with an amplitude of {\textasciitilde}0.015 mag and a 12.3+/-0.3
day period. This is consistent with spectroscopically observed Ca II H
and K emission levels and line-broadening measurements but inconsistent
with rotational modulation of surface activity as the cause of the
radial velocity variability. Our photometric observations rule out
transits of the planetary companion.},

  abstract = {Kepler-78b is a transiting planet that is 1.2 times the size of Earth and orbits a young K dwarf every 8 hours. Two teams independently reported the mass of Kepler-78b based on radial velocity measurements using the HIRES and HARPS-N spectrographs. We modeled these datasets using a nonparametric Gaussian process (GP) regression. We considered three kernel functions for our GP models to account for the quasi-periodic activity from the young host star. All three kernel functions gave consistent Doppler amplitudes. Based on a likelihood analysis, we selected a quasi-periodic kernel that gives a Doppler amplitude of 1.86 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.25 m s\$\^{}\{-1\}\$. The mass of 1.87 \$\^{}\{+0.27\}\_\{-0.26\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ is more precise than can be measured with either data set (a 2.5-\{{\textbackslash}sigma\} improvement on the HIRES data). Reanalyzing only the HIRES data with a GP model, we reach a Doppler signal uncertainty equivalent with the previous study using slightly more than half of the HIRES measurements. Our GP model is the first analysis of the RVs for this active star that accounts for continuously varying, quasi-periodic stellar activity signal. Based on our mass and the radius measurement from transit photometry, Kepler-78b has a bulk density of 6.0\$\^{}\{+1.9\}\_\{-1.4\}\$ g cm\$\^{}\{-3\}\$. We estimate that Kepler-78b is 32\${\textbackslash}pm\$26\% iron using a two-component rock-iron model. This is consistent with an Earth-like composition, with uncertainty spanning Moon-like to Mercury-like compositions.},

the Long Camera from Nov. 1992 to April 1998. The CES survey has
monitored 37 late-type (F8V - M5V) stars in the southern hemisphere for
variations in their differential radial velocities (RV) in order to
detect Doppler reflex motions caused by planetary companions. This led
to the discovery of the first extrasolar planet in an Earth-like orbit
around the young (ZAMS) and active G0V star iota Horologii (K{\"u}rster
et al. {\textbackslash}cite\{martin00\}). Here we present the RV results for all survey
stars and perform a statistical examination of the whole data-set. Each
star is tested for RV variability, RV trends (linear and non-linear) and
significant periodic signals. beta Hyi and epsilon Ind are identified as
long-term, low-amplitude RV variables. Furthermore, for 30 CES survey
stars we determine quantitative upper mass-limits for giant planets
based on our long-term RV results. We find that the CES Long Camera
survey would have detected short-period (``51 Peg-type'') planets around
all 30 stars but no planets with msin i \ensuremath{<} 1 \{M\}\_Jup at orbital
separations larger than 2 AU. Finally, we demonstrate that the CES
planet search can be continued without applying velocity corrections to
the RV results coming from the currently installed Very Long Camera at

  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01532},
  abstract = {Context. We present the discovery of two transiting extrasolar planets by the satellite CoRoT. Aims. We aim at a characterization of the planetary bulk parameters, which allow us to further investigate the formation and evolution of the planetary systems and the main properties of the host stars. Methods. We used the transit light curve to characterize the planetary parameters relative to the stellar parameters. The analysis of HARPS spectra established the planetary nature of the detections, providing their masses. Further photometric and spectroscopic ground-based observations provided stellar parameters (log g,Teff,v sin i) to characterize the host stars. Our model takes the geometry of the transit to constrain the stellar density into account, which when linked to stellar evolutionary models, determines the bulk parameters of the star. Because of the asymmetric shape of the light curve of one of the planets, we had to include the possibility in our model that the stellar surface was not strictly spherical. Results. We present the planetary parameters of CoRoT-28b, a Jupiter-sized planet (mass 0.484+/-0.087MJup; radius 0.955+/-0.066RJup) orbiting an evolved star with an orbital period of 5.208 51 +/- 0.000 38 days, and CoRoT-29b, another Jupiter-sized planet (mass 0.85 +/- 0.20MJup; radius 0.90 +/- 0.16RJup) orbiting an oblate star with an orbital period of 2.850 570 +/- 0.000 006 days. The reason behind the asymmetry of the transit shape is not understood at this point. Conclusions. These two new planetary systems have very interesting properties and deserve further study, particularly in the case of the star CoRoT-29.},

  abstract = {Context. Since low-mass stars have low luminosities, orbits at which liquid water can exist on Earth-sized planets are relatively close-
in, which produces Doppler signals that are detectable using state-of-the-art Doppler spectroscopy.
Aims. GJ 667C is already known to be orbited by two super-Earth candidates. We have recently applied developed data analysis
methods to investigate whether the data supports the presence of additional companions.
Methods. We obtain new Doppler measurements from HARPS extracted spectra and combined them with those obtained from the PFS
and HIRES spectrographs. We used Bayesian and periodogram-based methods to re-assess the number of candidates and evaluated
the confidence of each detection. Among other tests, we validated the planet candidates by analyzing correlations of each Doppler
signal with measurements of several activity indices and investigated the possible quasi-periodic nature of signals.
Results. Doppler measurements of GJ 667C are described better by six (even seven) Keplerian-like signals: the two known candidates
(b and c); three additional few-Earth mass candidates with periods of 92, 62, and 39 days (d, e and f); a cold super-Earth in a 260-day
orbit (g) and tantalizing evidence of a \ensuremath{\sim}1 M\ensuremath{\oplus} object in a close-in orbit of 17 days (h). We explore whether long-term stable orbits are
compatible with the data by integrating 8 {\texttimes} 104 solutions derived from the Bayesian samplings. We assess their stability using secular
frequency analysis.
Conclusions. The system consisting of six planets is compatible with dynamically stable configurations. As for the solar system,
the most stable solutions do not contain mean-motion resonances and are described well by analytic Laplace-Lagrange solutions.
Preliminary analysis also indicates that masses of the planets cannot be higher than twice the minimum masses obtained from Doppler
measurements. The presence of a seventh planet (h) is supported by the fact that it appears squarely centered on the only island of
stability left in the six-planet solution. Habitability assessments accounting for the stellar flux, as well as tidal dissipation effects,
indicate that three (maybe four) planets are potentially habitable. Doppler and space-based transit surveys indicate that 1) dynamically
packed systems of super-Earths are relatively abundant and 2) M-dwarfs have more small planets than earlier-type stars. These two
trends together suggest that GJ 667C is one of the first members of an emerging population of M-stars with multiple low-mass planets
in their habitable zones.},

  abstract = {Frequency of detected giant planets is observed to increase rapidly with metallicity of the host star. This is usually interpreted as evidence in support of the Core Accretion (CA) theory, which assembles giant planets as a result of formation of a massive solid core. A strong positive planet-metallicity correlation for giant planets formed in the framework of Gravitational disc Instability (GI) model is found here. The key novelty of this work is "pebble accretion" onto GI fragments which has been recently demonstrated to accelerate contraction of GI fragments. Driven closer to the star by the inward migration, only the fragments that accrete metals rapidly enough collapse and survive the otherwise imminent tidal disruption. The survival fraction of simulated planets correlates strongly with the metallicity of the host star, as observed.},

  abstract = {We present an in-depth analysis of stellar activity and its effects on radial velocity (RV) for the M2 dwarf GJ 176 based on spectra taken over 10 years from the High Resolution Spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. These data are supplemented with spectra from previous observations with the HIRES and HARPS spectrographs, and V- and R-band photometry taken over 6 years at the Dyer and Fairborn observatories. Previous studies of GJ 176 revealed a super-Earth exoplanet in an 8.8-day orbit. However, the velocities of this star are also known to be contaminated by activity, particularly at the 39-day stellar rotation period. We have examined the magnetic activity of GJ 176 using the sodium I D lines, which have been shown to be a sensitive activity tracer in cool stars. In addition to rotational modulation, we see evidence of a long-term trend in our Na I D index, which may be part of a long-period activity cycle. The sodium index is well correlated with our RVs, and we show that this activity trend drives a corresponding slope in RV. Interestingly, the rotation signal remains in phase in photometry, but not in the spectral activity indicators. We interpret this phenomenon as the result of one or more large spot complexes or active regions which dominate the photometric variability, while the spectral indices are driven by the overall magnetic activity across the stellar surface. In light of these results, we discuss the potential for correcting activity signals in the RVs of M dwarfs.},

  abstract = {We analyzed the host stars of the present sample of confirmed planets detected by Kepler and Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) to compute new photometric rotation periods and to study the behavior of their angular momentum. Lomb-Scargle periodograms and wavelet maps were computed for 3,807 stars. For 540 of these stars, we were able to detect rotational modulation of the light curves at a significance level of greater than 99\%. For 63 of these 540 stars, no rotation measurements were previously available in the literature. According to the published masses and evolutionary tracks of the stars in this sample, the sample is composed of M- to F-type stars (with masses of 0.48-1.53 M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) with rotation periods that span a range of 2 to 89 days. These periods exhibit an excellent agreement with previously reported (for the stars for which such values are available), and the observed rotational period distribution strongly agrees with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, for the 540 sources considered here, the stellar angular momentum provides an important test of Kraft's relation based on the photometric rotation periods. Finally, this study directly contributes in a direct approach to our understanding of how angular momentum is distributed between the host star and its (detected) planetary system; the role of angular momentum exchange in such systems is an unavoidable piece of the stellar rotation puzzle.},

In this work, we analyze its transit signal and the radial velocity data obtained with the Calar Alto Fiber-fed Echelle spectrograph (CAFE). By simultaneously modeling both datasets, we obtain the orbital and physical properties of the system. According to our results, Kepler-447b is a Jupiter-mass planet (\$M\_p=1.37\^{}\{+0.48\}\_\{-0.46\}{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$), with an estimated radius of \$R\_p=1.65\^{}\{+0.59\}\_\{-0.56\}{\textasciitilde}R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$ (uncertainties provided in this work are \$3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ unless specified). This translates into a sub-Jupiter density. The planet revolves every \${\textbackslash}sim7.8\$ days in a slightly eccentric orbit (\$e=0.123\^{}\{+0.037\}\_\{-0.036\}\$) around a G8V star with detected activity in the Kepler light curve. Kepler-447b transits its host with a large impact parameter (\$b=1.076\^{}\{+0.112\}\_\{-0.086\}\$), being one of the few planetary grazing transits confirmed so far and the first in the Kepler large crop of exoplanets. We estimate that only around 20\% of the projected planet disk occults the stellar disk. The relatively large uncertainties in the planet radius are due to the large impact parameter and short duration of the transit. Planets with such an extremely large impact parameter can be used to detect and analyze interesting configurations such as additional perturbing bodies, stellar pulsations, rotation of a non-spherical planet, or polar spot-crossing events. All these scenarios would periodically modify the transit properties (depth, duration, and time of mid-transit), what could be detectable with sufficient accurate photometry. Short-cadence photometric data (at the 1 minute level) would help in the search for these exotic configurations in grazing planetary transits like that of Kepler-447b.},

The result is a robust algorithm that is rapid enough for use in real-time analysis that outputs constraints on orbital parameters and false-alarm probabilities for the planet and long-term trend. The constraints on parameters and odds ratio that we derive compare well with previous calculations based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, and we compare our results with other techniques for estimating false-alarm probabilities and errors in derived orbital parameters. False-alarm probabilities from the Bayesian analysis are systematically higher than frequentist false-alarm probabilities, due to the different accounting of the number of trials.

  abstract = {We present a simple and powerful method for extracting a transit signal from noisy light curves. Assuming the signal is periodic, we illustrate that systematic noise can be removed in Fourier space at all frequencies, by only using data from inside a time window which is matched to the main planet transits. This results in a reconstruction of the signal which on average is unbiased, despite that no prior knowledge of either the noise or the transit signal itself is used in the analysis. The method has therefore clear advantages over standard phase folding, which normally requires external input such as nearby stars or noise models for removing systematic components. In addition, we extract the full 360 degree transit signal simultaneously, and Kepler like data can be analyzed in just a few seconds. We illustrate the performance of our method by applying it to a dataset composed of light curves from Kepler with a fake injected signal emulating a planet with rings. For extracting periodic transit signals, our presented method is in general the optimal and least biased estimator and could therefore lead the way towards the first detections of, e.g., planet rings and exo-trojan asteroids.},

  abstract = {Rotation periods are reported for 14 main-sequence stars, bringing the total number of such stars with well determined rotation periods to 41. It is found that the mean level of their Ca II H and K emission
(averaged over 15 years) is correlated with rotation period, as
expected. However, there is a further dependence of the emission on spectral type. When expressed as the ratio of chromospheric flux to total bolometric flux, the emission is well correlated with the
parameter P(obs)/tau(c), where P(obs) is the observed rotation period and tau(c)(B - V) is a theoretically-derived convective overturn time, calculated assuming a mixing length to scale height ratio alpha of about 2. This finding is consonant with general predictions of dynamo theory, if the relation between chromospheric emission and dynamo-generated magnetic fields is essentially independent of rotation rate and spectral type for the stars considered. The dependence of mean chromospheric emission on rotation and spectral type is essentially the same for stars above and below the Vaughan-Preston (1980) 'gap', thus casting doubt on explanations of the gap in terms of a discontinuity in dynamo
characteristics.},

  abstract = {The discovery of an exomoon would provide deep insights into planet formation and the habitability of planetary systems, with transiting examples being particularly sought after. Of the hundreds of Kepler planets now discovered, the seven-planet system Kepler-90 is unusual for exhibiting an unidentified transit-like signal in close proximity to one of the transits of the long-period gas-giant Kepler-90g, as noted by Cabrera et. al. (2014). As part of the 'Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler' (HEK) project, we investigate this possible exomoon signal and find it passes all conventional photometric, dynamical and centroid diagnostic tests. However, pixel-level light curves indicate that the moon-like signal occurs on nearly all of the target's pixels, which we confirm using a novel way of examining pixel-level data which we dub the 'transit centroid'. This test reveals that the possible exomoon to Kepler-90g is likely a false positive, perhaps due to a cosmic ray induced Sudden Pixel Sensitivity Dropout (SPSD). This work highlights the extreme care required for seeking non-periodic low-amplitude transit signals, such as exomoons.},

  abstract = {The Gl 581 planetary system has generated wide interest, because its 4 planets include both the lowest mass planet known around a main sequence star other than the Sun and the first super-Earth planet in the habitable zone of its star. A recent paper announced the possible discovery of two additional super-Earth planets in that system, one of which would be in the middle of the habitable zone of Gl 581. The statistical significance of those two discoveries has, however, been questioned. We have obtained 121 new radial velocity measurements of Gl 581 with the HARPS spectrograph on the ESO 3.6 m telescope, and analyse those together with our previous 119 measurements of that star to examine these potential additional planets. We find that neither is likely to exist with their proposed parameters. We also obtained photometric observations with the 2.5 m Isaac Newton Telescope during a potential transit of the inner planet, Gl 581e, which had a 5\% geometric transit probability. Those observations exclude transits for planet densities under 4 times the Earth density within -0.2 sigma to +2.7 sigma of the predicted transit center.},

  abstract = {The Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of planets with radii \$\ensuremath{<}4 R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, paving the way for the first statistical studies of the dynamics, formation, and evolution of these sub-Neptunes and super-Earths. Planetary masses are an important physical property for these studies, and yet the vast majority of Kepler planet candidates do not have theirs measured. A key concern for these studies is therefore how to map the measured radii to mass estimates for this Earth-to-Neptune size range where there are no Solar System analogs. Previous works have derived deterministic, one-to-one relationships between radius and mass. However, if these planets span a range of compositions as expected, then an intrinsic scatter about this relationship must exist in the population. Here we present the first probabilistic mass-radius relationship (M-R relation) evaluated within a Bayesian framework, which both quantifies this intrinsic dispersion and the uncertainties on the M-R relation parameters. We analyze how the details depend on the radius range of the sample, and on the method used to provide the mass measurements. Assuming that the M-R relation can be described as a power law with a dispersion that is constant and normally distributed, we find that \$M/M\_{\textbackslash}oplus=2.7(R/R\_{\textbackslash}oplus)\^{}\{1.3\}\$ and a scatter in mass of \$1.9M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ is the "best-fit" probabilistic M-R relation for the sample of RV-measured transiting sub-Neptunes (\$R\_\{pl\}\ensuremath{<}4 R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$).},

  abstract = {The detection of exoplanets using any method is prone to confusion due to the intrinsic variability of the host star. We investigate the effect of cool starspots on the detectability of the exoplanets around solar-like stars using the radial velocity method. For investigating this activity-caused "jitter" we calculate synthetic spectra using radiative transfer, known stellar atomic and molecular lines, different surface spot configurations, and an added planetary signal. Here, the methods are described in detail, tested and compared to previously published studies. The methods are also applied to investigate the activity jitter in old and young solar-like stars, and over a solar-like activity cycles. We find that the mean full jitter amplitude obtained from the spot surfaces mimicking the solar activity varies during the cycle approximately between 1 m/s and 9 m/s. With a realistic observing frequency a Neptune mass planet on a one year orbit can be reliably recovered. On the other hand, the recovery of an Earth mass planet on a similar orbit is not feasible with high significance. The methods developed in this study have a great potential for doing statistical studies of planet detectability, and also for investigating the effect of stellar activity on recovered planetary parameters.},

combination of precise radial-velocity measurements from three
telescopes reveals the presence of a planet with a period of 35.68 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.03 days and minimum mass (m sin i) of 5.4 \ensuremath{\pm} 1.0 Earth
masses. GJ 832c moves on a low-eccentricity orbit (e = 0.18 \ensuremath{\pm}
0.13) toward the inner edge of the habitable zone. However, given the large mass of the planet, it seems likely that it would possess a massive atmosphere, which may well render the planet inhospitable. Indeed, it is perhaps more likely that GJ 832c is a "super-Venus," featuring significant greenhouse forcing. With an outer giant planet and an interior, potentially rocky planet, the GJ 832 planetary system can be thought of as a miniature version of our own solar system.
